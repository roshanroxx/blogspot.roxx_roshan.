    <div class="text">
     <p>  <span class="span">Quantum programming </span> is the process of assembling sequences of instructions, called quantum programs, that are capable of running on a quantum computer.
         Quantum programming languages help express quantum algorithms using high-level constructs.
     </p>
     <p>
        There are two main groups of quantum programming languages:<span class="span"> imperative quantum</span> programming languages and <span class="span">functional quantum</span>  programming languages.
     </p> 
     <p>
        Quantum instruction sets are used to turn higher level algorithms into physical instructions that can be executed on quantum processors.
         Sometimes these instructions are specific to a given hardware platform, e.g. <span class="span"> ion traps</span> or <span class="span">superconducting qubits</span> .
     </p>
     <p>
        Quil is an instruction set architecture for quantum computing that first introduced a shared quantum/classical memory model.
         It was introduced by Robert Smith, Michael Curtis, and William Zeng in <span class="span">A Practical Quantum Instruction Set Architecture</span> .
          Many quantum algorithms (including quantum teleportation, quantum error correction, simulation, and optimization algorithms) require a shared memory architecture
     </p>
     <p>
        Quantum <span class="span">software development kits</span>  provide collections of tools to create and manipulate quantum programs.
         They also provide the means to simulate the quantum programs or prepare them to be run using cloud-based quantum devices.
